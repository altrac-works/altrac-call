    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>HB107 codifies inaccurate definitions of "male" and "female" into state law, laying the foundation for a future "bathroom bill", and generally writing trans people out of the legal code. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them that you oppose HB107. Call your own senator too, if you have time, although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the Senate yet.</li>
      <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators, it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state &mdash; rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people. See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
      <li>Don't be discouraged if you reach voicemail &mdash; leave a message. Every call counts.</li>
      <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>.</strong>

    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The legislature has more important things to do.</strong> For example, we usually don't pass a budget until the very end of the session, and there are plenty of bills that would actually benefit Alabama businesses and citizens.</li>
      <li><strong>Nobody asked for this bill.</strong> Even the sponsor of the bill, Representative DuBose, has had trouble explaining what specific event or data point caused her to introduce it. It is a bill in search of a problem, and isn't worth the House's time.</li>
      <li><strong>It would further crowd the prison system with innocent people who dared to use a bathroom or changing room in peace.</strong> The Alabama prison system has an overcrowding problem that leads to violence and unsanitary conditions. The rate of sexual victimization for transgender inmates nationwide occurs at a rate of about 10x that of other inmates. Transgender inmates are almost universally sorted based on their sex assigned at birth, a practice which HB111 codifies. This would ensure that a vulnerable portion of the prison population continues to suffer needlessly and indefinitely.</li>
      <li><strong>The bill is vague about what it actually applies to</strong> and would have bizarre unintended consequences. If it applies to the entirety of state law...
          <ul>
            <li>That includes, for example, every instance where code talks about "female breasts" &mdash; are trans women now allowed to have their bare breasts exposed in public without consequences (while cis women aren't)?</li>
            <li>Can hair stylists in Jefferson County who only do work for women lose their exemption from barber licensing (AL Code § 45-37-40 (2022)) if they accidentally provide services to a trans woman?</li>
            <li>If these types of things aren't the point, what part of state law is this really targeting?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>
    <p>SB79 makes a number of changes to bathroom, changing room, and sleeping accommodation access in public facilities, including schools and prisons. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Please call <strong>your state senator</strong> and tell them that you oppose SB79. Call your own senator too, if you have time, although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the House yet.
      <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators, it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state — rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people. See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
      <li>Don't be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every call counts.</li>
      <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>.</strong>

    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It has numerous unintended consequences. The bill paints in such broad strokes that it:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Bans public universities from opening overnight disaster shelters</strong> with mixed-gender sleeping areas. While there is an exemption for “render[ing] aid during a natural disaster” it only applies when the space “is not in use.”</li>
        <li><strong>Might require universities to police dorms and prevent straight couples from entering each other’s dorm rooms.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>It would ban intersex people, who were born neither male nor female, from many public spaces.</strong> Since there is no requirement for single-occupancy bathrooms in public buildings, and all multiple-occupancy bathrooms must be designated and enforced for use by either “males” or “females”, these individuals would not be able to use bathrooms in some public buildings at all. Intersex people are not disabled, and so are not protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act carve-out.</li>
      <li><strong>It will make non-transgender people uncomfortable.</strong> The law would require non-transgender men to share changing room space with transgender women, some of whom have fully developed breasts. And it would require non-transgender women to share changing room space with transgender men, some of whom have beards and deep voices. This would be very uncomfortable for the non-transgender people involved.</li>
      <li><strong>It places an undue burden on schools and universities.</strong> The law requires that schools and universities enforce it. But determining if someone meets the definitions of “male” and “female” in this law is near-impossible in many situations.<ul>
        <li>Do we expect women who just don’t look feminine enough to show their birth certificates at the bathroom door? Even that is not enough, because in many states, it is easy for transgender people to obtain corrected birth certificates. Do we expect universities to perform chromosomal testing and include this information on student IDs?</li>
        <li>How do we expect all public universities to strictly prevent women from entering their boyfriend’s dorm room?</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>It isn’t consistent with other proposed legislation.</strong> Its definition of “male” and “female” are subtly different than those proposed in HB109, Susan DuBose’s “What is a Woman Act.” And the supposedly immutable definitions of “male” and “female” are changed from the K-12 bathroom ban introduced in a previous legislative session.</li>
