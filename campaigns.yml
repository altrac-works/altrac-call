    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>SB101 and SB58 requires written opt-in permission from parents for minors to receive medical care or counseling services. They are clearly meant to block youth from receiving reproductive health or gender affirming care without parental consent, but its consequences would be much farther reaching than intended. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your state Senator</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose Senate Bill 101 and Senate Bill 58. Call your own House rep too, if you have time.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
            it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
            important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
            unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
            rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people.
            See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
        <li>Don’t be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every
            call counts.</li>
        <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can
            write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk
        about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>. Otherwise, <strong>skim
            these bullet points, pick a few that resonate with you, and be prepared
            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful. <strong>In states with similar laws...</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>...schools are afraid to offer first aid without permission slips.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The legislature might then blame the schools for malicious compliance. However, this bill would in fact prohibit giving even basic first aid to a child at school, much less calling an ambulance if a child broke a leg on the playground, without first contacting the child's parent.</li>
          <li>There is an exception for life-threatening care, but not for first aid.</li>
          <li>The default for this statute should be opt-out, rather than opt-in. Parents worried about their rights can fill out the form, and all of us who forget to fill it out don't have to rush over from work to put our bleeding kids in our cars.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>...children in unstable living situations, such as those with absent or incarcerated parents, have difficulty getting any medical care at all.</strong><ul>

        <li>Even if someone else, perhaps a grandparent, were to be appointed guardian, this would take time. In the case of serious but not immediately life threatening medical issues which yet require timely treatment, this delay could be deadly. This bill would put such children's lives at risk.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>...children of abusers are not able to meet confidentially with a medical or mental health provider.</strong><ul>
        <li>They would first need permission from their abuser to get an appointment.</li>
        <li>If they obtained an appointment and discussed their abuse with the provider, their abuser would have the right to see the medical records. There are legitimate reasons why children need confidentiality.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p><strong>House Bill 67</strong> could punish innocent transgender Alabamians simply for being present at schools or libraries. The bill’s main goal is to ban drag performances, but it is written such that transgender people would also be impacted. It also bans transgender youth from sleepaway camps.</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose HB67. Call your own senator too, if you have time,
            although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the Senate
            yet.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
            it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
            important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
            unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
            rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people.

            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HB67 violates the single-subject rule laid out in the
      Alabama Constitution by containing two completely distinct
      parts.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>The first part bans “drag” in libraries and schools, and the second
      part bans trans kids from sleepaway camps. <strong>These are not
      sufficiently related to pass a single-subject test.</strong><br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><strong>The bill’s sponsor says the goal of this bill is banning
      “drag performances” in schools and public libraries, but it’s worded so
      vaguely that it would have far-reaching consequences.</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li><strong>The definition of what drag looks like is immensely broad
      and vague.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>It encompasses anything that a bad actor would want it to
      mean.<br />
      </li>
      <li>Under this definition, if someone doesn’t conform to another
      person’s taste in clothing, they could argue that that person is in
      violation of this law.
      <ul>
      <li>In extremely bad-faith cases, men wearing kilts and women wearing
      pants could qualify as “drag.” This is clearly not the intention of the
      bill.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Drag is defined as a “performance,” but it never specifies what
      qualifies as a performance.<br />
      </li>
      <li>The way it’s written, <strong>girls couldn’t play male roles in high
      school theater where there are usually not usually not enough boys to
      fill the male roles.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Classic plays and musicals where cross dressing is part of the plot
      would no longer be performable.<br />
      </li>
      <li>It would also prohibit a girl from dressing up as George Washington
      for a classroom presentation.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Teachers and students shouldn’t have to be paranoid that they’re
      breaking whatever law the Alabama state legislature drums up —
      <strong>they should instead be able to enjoy the freedom of speech and
      expression that’s guaranteed to them in the US
      Constitution.</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li>Do we really need state officials policing how people dress in
      public libraries?
      <ul>
      <li>Can women wear pants or suits without being accused of “performing”
      masculine “gender identity”?<br />
      </li>
      <li>This is a slippery slope of our elected officials pushing a personal
      agenda without any bases and restricting freedom of speech and
      expression.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Would leave school boards and the state open to lawsuits, which
      would cost taxpayers.<br />
      </li>
      <li>This is another bill in search of a problem. It is only there to
      further alienate anyone who looks different without any basis to do
      so.</li>
    </ul>
