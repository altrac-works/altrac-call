    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>HB107 and SB79 codify inaccurate definitions of "male" and "female" into state law, laying the foundation for a future "bathroom bill", and generally writing trans people out of the legal code. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House and your state Senator</strong> and tell them that you oppose <strong>HB107 and SB79</strong>.</li>
      <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators, it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state &mdash; rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people. See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
      <li>Don't be discouraged if you reach voicemail &mdash; leave a message. Every call counts.</li>
      <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>.</strong>

    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The legislature has more important things to do.</strong> For example, we usually don't pass a budget until the very end of the session, and there are plenty of bills that would actually benefit Alabama businesses and citizens.</li>
      <li><strong>Nobody asked for this bill.</strong> Even the sponsor of the bill, Representative DuBose, has had trouble explaining what specific event or data point caused her to introduce it. It is a bill in search of a problem, and isn't worth the House's time.</li>
      <li><strong>It would further crowd the prison system with innocent people who dared to use a bathroom or changing room in peace.</strong> The Alabama prison system has an overcrowding problem that leads to violence and unsanitary conditions. The rate of sexual victimization for transgender inmates nationwide occurs at a rate of about 10x that of other inmates. Transgender inmates are almost universally sorted based on their sex assigned at birth, a practice which HB111 codifies. This would ensure that a vulnerable portion of the prison population continues to suffer needlessly and indefinitely.</li>
      <li><strong>The bill is vague about what it actually applies to</strong> and would have bizarre unintended consequences. If it applies to the entirety of state law...
          <ul>
            <li>That includes, for example, every instance where code talks about "female breasts" &mdash; are trans women now allowed to have their bare breasts exposed in public without consequences (while cis women aren't)?</li>
            <li>Can hair stylists in Jefferson County who only do work for women lose their exemption from barber licensing (AL Code ยง 45-37-40 (2022)) if they accidentally provide services to a trans woman?</li>
            <li>If these types of things aren't the point, what part of state law is this really targeting?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
