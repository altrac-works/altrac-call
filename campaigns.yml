    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>SB101, SB58, and HB267 require written opt-in permission from parents for minors to receive medical care or counseling services. They are clearly meant to block youth from receiving reproductive health or gender affirming care without parental consent, but its consequences would be much farther reaching than intended. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your state Senator</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose Senate Bill 101 and Senate Bill 58. And call <strong>your House rep</strong> and tell them that you oppose House Bill 267.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
            it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
            important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
            unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
            rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people.
            See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
        <li>Don’t be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every
            call counts.</li>
        <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can
            write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk
        about, <a id="reps">skip these tips</a>. Otherwise, <strong>skim
            these bullet points, pick a few that resonate with you, and be prepared
            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful. <strong>In states with similar laws...</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>...schools are afraid to offer first aid without permission slips.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The legislature might then blame the schools for malicious compliance. However, this bill would in fact prohibit giving even basic first aid to a child at school, much less calling an ambulance if a child broke a leg on the playground, without first contacting the child's parent.</li>
          <li>There is an exception for life-threatening care, but not for first aid.</li>
          <li>The default for this statute should be opt-out, rather than opt-in. Parents worried about their rights can fill out the form, and all of us who forget to fill it out don't have to rush over from work to put our bleeding kids in our cars.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>...children in unstable living situations, such as those with absent or incarcerated parents, have difficulty getting any medical care at all.</strong><ul>

        <li>Even if someone else, perhaps a grandparent, were to be appointed guardian, this would take time. In the case of serious but not immediately life threatening medical issues which yet require timely treatment, this delay could be deadly. This bill would put such children's lives at risk.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>...children of abusers are not able to meet confidentially with a medical or mental health provider.</strong><ul>
        <li>They would first need permission from their abuser to get an appointment.</li>
        <li>If they obtained an appointment and discussed their abuse with the provider, their abuser would have the right to see the medical records. There are legitimate reasons why children need confidentiality.</li>

    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p><strong>House Bill 67</strong> could punish innocent transgender Alabamians simply for being present at schools or libraries. The bill’s main goal is to ban drag performances, but it is written such that transgender people would also be impacted. It also bans transgender youth from sleepaway camps.</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose HB67. Call your own senator too, if you have time,
            although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the Senate
            yet.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,

            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HB67 violates the single-subject rule laid out in the
      Alabama Constitution by containing two completely distinct
      parts.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>The first part bans “drag” in libraries and schools, and the second
      part bans trans kids from sleepaway camps. <strong>These are not
      sufficiently related to pass a single-subject test.</strong><br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><strong>The bill’s sponsor says the goal of this bill is banning
      “drag performances” in schools and public libraries, but it’s worded so
      vaguely that it would have far-reaching consequences.</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li><strong>The definition of what drag looks like is immensely broad
      and vague.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>It encompasses anything that a bad actor would want it to
      mean.<br />
      </li>
      <li>Under this definition, if someone doesn’t conform to another
      person’s taste in clothing, they could argue that that person is in
      violation of this law.
      <ul>
      <li>In extremely bad-faith cases, men wearing kilts and women wearing
      pants could qualify as “drag.” This is clearly not the intention of the
      bill.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Drag is defined as a “performance,” but it never specifies what
      qualifies as a performance.<br />
      </li>
      <li>The way it’s written, <strong>girls couldn’t play male roles in high
      school theater where there are usually not usually not enough boys to
      fill the male roles.</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Classic plays and musicals where cross dressing is part of the plot
      would no longer be performable.<br />
      </li>
      <li>It would also prohibit a girl from dressing up as George Washington
      for a classroom presentation.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Teachers and students shouldn’t have to be paranoid that they’re
      breaking whatever law the Alabama state legislature drums up —
      <strong>they should instead be able to enjoy the freedom of speech and
      expression that’s guaranteed to them in the US
      Constitution.</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li>Do we really need state officials policing how people dress in
      public libraries?
      <ul>
      <li>Can women wear pants or suits without being accused of “performing”
      masculine “gender identity”?<br />
      </li>
      <li>This is a slippery slope of our elected officials pushing a personal
      agenda without any bases and restricting freedom of speech and
      expression.<br />
      </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Would leave school boards and the state open to lawsuits, which
      would cost taxpayers.<br />
      </li>
      <li>This is another bill in search of a problem. It is only there to
      further alienate anyone who looks different without any basis to do
      so.</li>

    <p>We are one week into the 2025 Alabama Legislative session and already
    have multiple discriminatory and unconstitutional bills we are pushing
    back against. Today we are asking you to tell your State House
    Representative to <strong>VOTE NO on HB4</strong>, an anti-trans,
    anti-education, anti-worker bill. Beyond its violations of 1st Amendment
    Rights of all Alabamians and the repercussions it will have on workers
    in public schools and libraries, it will also criminalize transgender
    and gender nonconforming community members for daring to exist in these
    public spaces. We are calling on you to call or write <strong>your House
    Representative</strong> and tell them why you want them to VOTE NO on
    HB4 using the talking points below. If you have time, please also call <strong>your state Senator</strong>, but be mindful that this bill has not been introduced in the Senate yet.</p>

    <h3 id="hb4-is-vague-and-redundant">HB4 is Vague and Redundant</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>HB4 is redundant.The Alabama Public LIbrary Service Board has
    already changed the administrative code to remove “sexually explicit and
    other materials deemed inappropriate for children and youth” from the
    children’s and young adult sections of all public libraries in the
    state.<br />
    </li>
    <li>HB4 expands the definition of “sexual conduct” within the state
    obscenity code to include “Gender oriented conduct” and “exaggerated or
    provocative clothing” defining both as criminal behavior, but only in
    public libraries and schools. Can the state legally apply two different
    definitions to the same term?<br />
    </li>
    <li>The terms “gender oriented conduct” and “exaggerated or provocative
    clothing” are vague and would put everyone at risk of being criminally
    charged just for being in the library. Although the bill clearly targets
    transgender people and drag performers, the vagueness of the bill would
    even open the door for a patron to report a cisgender woman for wearing
    a shirt they think is too revealing or a cisgender man for wearing nail
    polish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="consequences-of-hb4">Consequences of HB4</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>HB4 applies to all areas of public schools, not just school
    libraries. How would it affect activities such as cheerleading, dance
    programs, theater performances, art exhibitions, sports teams, and
    uniforms/costuming for all of these? HB4 targets girls and women,
    transgender students and their families, and anyone who is gender
    non-confirming in public schools.<br />
    </li>
    <li>HB4’s expansion of the definition of “sexual conduct” would lead to
    either a ban on all LGBTQ+ library materials and programs regardless of
    their sexual content or the creation of age restricted sections in all
    Alabama public libraries. In small and/or rural libraries, creating age
    restricted sections could be logistically impossible. This could lead
    entire libraries to become age restricted, keeping minors out
    completely.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="hb4-violates-my-constitutional-rights">HB4 Violates My
    Constitutional Rights!</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas just
    declared that <a
    href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2024/12/23/arkansas-book-censorship-law-ruled-unconstitutional">Arkansas’s
    similar bill (Arkansas Act 372)</a> is unconstitutional, overbroad, and
    void for vagueness.<br />
    </li>
    <li>HB4 could lead to libraries’ overcorrecting on what books they
    shelve or what programs they put on in order to protect themselves from
    the threat of criminal prosecution. This will violate the First
    Amendment rights of patrons.<br />
    </li>
    <li>HB4 violates the 14th Amendment right to freedom of expression by
    prohibiting “gender oriented conduct” and “exaggerated or provocative
    clothing.”<br />
    </li>
    <li>This bill violates the 14th Amendment right to equal protection
    under the law. If this bill is targeting “drag queen story hour” for its
    “gender oriented conduct”, but not cis-gendered storytelling events that
    also have “gender oriented conduct” such as princess storytime, then the
    bill would not be applied equally to all those who read to children in
    storyhours across our libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="hb4-will-place-extensive-financial-burden-on-taxpayers">HB4 Will
    Place Extensive Financial Burden on Taxpayers</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>HB4 will impose significant financial costs to public libraries,
    schools, municipalities, and taxpayers across the state.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Libraries and school districts will have to increase their insurance
    to cover criminal liability. Who will fund those increased costs?<br />
    </li>
    <li>City councils and county commissions will be expected to foot the
    bill for additional law enforcement costs.<br />
    </li>
    <li>HB4 will inevitably lead to costly lawsuits against the state or
    violation of First Amendment rights like it did in Arkansas and
    Missouri.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="hb4-is-unnecessary">HB4 is Unnecessary</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>HB4 tries to solve a problem that does not exist. There is no
    evidence of harm or of a community need for this bill.<br />
    </li>
    <li>There is no evidence that any materials in the library or the
    presence of “gender oriented conduct” is harmful to minors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3
    id="hb4-will-have-significant-negative-consequences-for-library-patrons-students-families-and-workers">HB4
    will have significant negative consequences for library patrons,
    students, families, and workers</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>In many libraries across the state, materials go through multiple
    library staff members before making it to a shelf. When multiple staff
    members, as well board members, are involved in a reconsideration
    request to review materials for their appropriateness. This bill would
    make everyone in that chain criminally liable.<br />
    </li>
    <li>This bill encourages policing of anyone whose attire does not
    conform to someone else’s definition of gender appropriate. and of
    anyone wearing clothing someone thinks is too revealing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Libraries would have to adopt dress codes for their workers and
    patrons.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Minors could be held criminally liable for “gender oriented conduct”
    and “exaggerated or provocative clothing” in public schools and
    libraries.<br />
    </li>
    <li>What is to prevent library workers from being targeted by people
    with political or ideological agendas when this law is used against them
    as political backlash?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>House Bill 244</strong> would expand the current prohibition
    on discussing queer topics in schools so that it would now restrict
    pre-kindergarten all the way through grade 12. It would also ban Pride
    insignias in public schools, and it makes the misgendering of trans kids
    a <em>legal requirement</em> with which school employees must

    <li><strong>What effect would this bill have on textbooks, materials,

    </li>
    <li>The bill is so vague that it prevents discussion about even

    <ul>
    <li>There’s no need to subject our teachers to this kind of excessive

    instead.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>The bill will harm the state’s health education
    programs.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>The bill’s vague wording disallows discussion of even heterosexual
    relationships, which would be detrimental to sex education.
    <ul>
    <li>Alabama has the fifth highest rate of teen pregnancy in the nation,
    and the sixth highest rate of sexually transmitted diseases.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The bill’s moratorium on discussion of gender would disallow the
    gendering of reproductive health topics like menstruation — teachers
    would have to say “people who menstruate” to avoid mentioning gender
    identity.<br />
    </li>
    <li>We should be acting to educate children on these topics in a
    developmentally appropriate way, rather than banning discussion
    altogether as this bill does.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>This bill takes authority away from teachers to discipline
    students for bullying.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Under this law, teachers cannot discipline students who harass
    others for being gay or trans. This would further contribute to a school
    culture in Alabama where some kids are not welcome based on who they
    are.<br />

    <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them
    that you oppose HB246. Call your own senator too, if you have time,
    although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the Senate
    yet.<br />
    </li>
    <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
    it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
    important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
    unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
    rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people.
    See the talking points below for some ideas.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Don’t be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every
    call counts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can
    write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk
    about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>. Otherwise, <strong>skim
    these bullet points, pick a few that resonate with you, and be prepared
    to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>The legislation creates a new civil cause of action for
    <em>anyone</em> upset about how <em>anyone</em> in a school is
    addressed.</strong> This could be a non-transgender person who has
    changed their legal name. This could be a parent who just doesn’t like
    the short form of their child’s name their teacher is using, if it’s not
    a common diminutive. <strong>It could be a parent upset about how a
    totally unrelated child is being addressed.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>If a student has legally changed their name, and their
    professor calls them by their birth name, the professor would be in
    violation of this act and the student would have cause to sue.</strong>
    A student or their parent could still plausibly bring a civil action
    even if the professor was not aware of the name change.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>This is just another avenue by which teachers are open to
    harassment.</strong> Alabama already has a hard time finding teachers to
    work in schools. Giving parents and students another legal vehicle to
    get teachers fired is not going to attract the talent we need.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>After a successful lawsuit, this will take money away from
    state schools, which are already underfunded.</strong> Alabama is <a
    href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alabama">#45 in education
    nationwide</a>. We literally can’t afford this.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>This bill is badly written.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>This bill defines “male” and “female” as having “the reproductive
    system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes
    [eggs/sperm] for fertilization.” <strong>This bill’s definitions could
    be interpreted to mean that nobody is a man or woman unless they have
    fathered or mothered a child,</strong> or even that nobody is a woman at
    all, since eggs do not fertilize, but rather are themselves
    fertilized.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>This bill is unenforceable.</strong> Do we really expect
    teachers to know what reproductive systems their students have?
    How?<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>These definitions are inconsistent with other recently
    passed legislation.</strong> This bill uses a different definition of
    “female” than SB79, which was recently signed into law.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>This bill holds charter schools that receive public funding
    to a different standard.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Why should charter schools be excluded from this legislation? This
    is a matter of student and employee behavior and ought to be a priority
    across the educational landscape.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
