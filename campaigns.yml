    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>SB101 and SB58 requires written opt-in permission from parents for minors to receive medical care or counseling services. It is clearly meant to block youth from receiving reproductive health or gender affirming care without parental consent, but its consequences would be much farther reaching than intended. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose HB107. Call your own senator too, if you have time,
            although be mindful that the bill has not been introduced in the Senate
            yet.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
            it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
            important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
            unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
            rather than directly talking about the impacts on transgender people.
            See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
        <li>Don’t be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every
            call counts.</li>
        <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can
            write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk
        about, <a href="#reps">skip these tips</a>. Otherwise, <strong>skim
            these bullet points, pick a few that resonate with you, and be prepared
            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful. <strong>In states with similar laws...</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>...schools are afraid to offer first aid without permission slips.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The legislature might then blame the schools for malicious compliance. However, this bill would in fact prohibit giving even basic first aid to a child at school, much less calling an ambulance if a child broke a leg on the playground, without first contacting the child's parent.</li>
          <li>There is an exception for life-threatening care, but not for first aid.</li>
          <li>The default for this statute should be opt-out, rather than opt-in. Parents worried about their rights can fill out the form, and all of us who forget to fill it out don't have to rush over from work to put our bleeding kids in our cars.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>...children in unstable living situations, such as those with absent or incarcerated parents, have difficulty getting any medical care at all.</strong><ul>

        <li>Even if someone else, perhaps a grandparent, were to be appointed guardian, this would take time. In the case of serious but not immediately life threatening medical issues which yet require timely treatment, this delay could be deadly. This bill would put such children's lives at risk.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>children of abusers are not able to meet confidentially with a medical or mental health provider.</strong><ul>
        <li>They would first need permission from their abuser to get an appointment.</li>
        <li>If they obtained an appointment and discussed their abuse with the provider, their abuser would have the right to see the medical records. There are legitimate reasons why children need confidentiality.</li>
      </ul></li>

    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p>HB107 and SB79 codify inaccurate definitions of "male" and "female" into state law, laying the foundation for a future "bathroom bill", and generally writing trans people out of the legal code. Here are some tips for calling legislators:</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your rep in the House</strong> and tell them

    <p>Here are some talking points that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
        <li><strong>The sponsor of SB79, April Weaver, doesn’t even know what it
            does.</strong> In committee, she held that it “only defined terms,” even
            when presented with parts of her bill that go further than definitions.
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li>This is because she didn’t draft the bill — it was drafted by an
                    out-of-state special interest group that doesn’t have the best interests
                    of Alabamians in mind.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Both bill sponsors have repeatedly called this a “Women’s
            Bill of Rights” — nothing could be further from the truth.</strong>
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li>Susan DuBose, the sponsor of HB107 and similar bills for three years
                    in a row, has admitted that her bill doesn’t grant any woman any
                    rights.</li>
                <li>Both sponsors have said the bill’s purpose is to “protect women” —
                    when in reality, <strong>they’ve been told time and again in public
                        hearings that their bills would create opportunities for harassment and
                        discomfort in the “single-sex spaces” their bills claim to
                        create.</strong>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li>Cisgender women would be forced to share space with transgender men,
                            many of whom have developed full beards and deep voices in their
                            transition.</li>
                        <li>And cisgender men would have to share changing room space with
                            transgender women, who have obviously feminine figures and developed
                            breasts.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Trans people transition, and then it no longer makes sense
                    for us to occupy the spaces we once did.</strong> That’s a lot more
                    common-sense than deputizing vigilantes to inspect women’s bodies.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Despite the sponsors saying their definitions are as old as
            time and clear as day, they’ve changed them from 2023’s “What is a Woman
            Act” to now.</strong>
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li>But they still don’t acknowledge how complex biological sex actually
                    is, and how disconnected the narrow definitions are from how sex
                    categories are actually used.</li>
                <li><strong>Both April Weaver and Susan DuBose have sat through multiple
                    committee hearings where Ph.D biologists explain why their definitions
                    are incorrect.</strong>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li>Yet they continue to act as if they have never heard a
                            science-backed challenge to their bill. It is clear they are either not
                            legislating in good faith, or not paying attention to constituents’
                            concerns.</li>
                        <li>Biological sex is a complex tapestry weaved from the endocrine
                            system (hormones), secondary sex characteristics, and invisible
                            characteristics like chromosomes. These often do not align, even in
                            cisgender people.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Speakers from the Alabama Policy Institute and Eagle Forum
                    cited a vital statistics need for these definitions, but once again,
                    that couldn’t be further from the truth.</strong>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li>They brought up recording cancer rates by sex — but in fact, cancer
                            rates <em>are affected</em> by widely available medical transition
                            interventions.</li>
                        <li>Transgender men experience breast cancer at rates more similar to
                            cisgender men; and transgender women experience it at higher rates, like
                            other women.</li>
                        <li>Transgender women also experience prostate cancer at much lower
                            rates than cisgender men, despite this bill placing them in the same
                            category.</li>
                        <li>The data is most accurate when transgender people are defined as the
                            gender they know themselves to be.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><strong>The sponsor of SB79 insists she worked with “university
                    partners” to write the bill, but wouldn’t say who those partners were on
                    the floor.</strong>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li><strong>Every mainstream medical group acknowledges that transgender
                            people are real, and that transitioning is medically and scientifically
                            appropriate.</strong></li>
                    </ul></li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>The legislature has more important things to do.</strong>
            For example, we usually don’t pass a budget until the very end of the
            session, and there are plenty of bills that would actually benefit
            Alabama businesses and citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>Nobody asked for this bill.</strong>
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li>In the three years that they’ve introduced it, neither Senator
                    Weaver nor Representative DuBose have been able to provide a specific
                    event or data point that caused them to introduce it. The truth is they
                    have no reason to.</li>
                <li>It is a bill in search of a problem, and isn’t worth the House’s
                    time.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>It would further crowd the prison system with innocent
            people who dared to use a bathroom or changing room in peace.</strong>
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li>The Alabama prison system has an overcrowding problem that leads to
                    violence and unsanitary conditions.</li>
                <li>The rate of sexual victimization for transgender inmates nationwide
                    occurs at a rate of about 10x that of other inmates.</li>
                <li>Transgender inmates are almost universally sorted based on their sex
                    assigned at birth, a practice which HB111 codifies. This would ensure
                    that a vulnerable portion of the prison population continues to suffer
                    needlessly and indefinitely.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>The bill is vague about what it actually applies to</strong>
            and would have bizarre unintended consequences.
            <ul class="incremental">
                <li><strong>The sponsor of the bill has stated on the floor that these
                    definitions might be used to determine gender “fraud.”</strong>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li>But this isn’t explicitly mentioned in the law, and there is no
                            mechanism to provide guidance to agencies about this.</li>
                        <li>If this is “only a simple definitions bill”, why are we talking
                            about fraud?</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>If it applies to the entirety of state law…
                    <ul class="incremental">
                        <li>That includes, for example, every instance where code talks about
                            “female breasts” — are trans women now allowed to have their bare
                            breasts exposed in public without consequences (while cis women
                            aren’t)?</li>
                        <li>Can hair stylists in Jefferson County who only do work for women
                            lose their exemption from barber licensing (AL Code § 45-37-40 (2022))
                            if they accidentally provide services to a trans woman?</li>
                        <li>If these types of things aren’t the point, what part of state law is
                            this really targeting?</li>
                    </ul></li>
