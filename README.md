# ALTRAC Call Tool

* You need `pip3 install flask requests pyyaml`
* You need a Google Maps API key that is not mine lol (edit `templates/call.html`)
* `call.py` will listen on `127.0.0.1:8899`, just proxy `/call/` on your domain to this host

`campaigns.yml` will let you configure a campaign

## TODO

so many things

* change default campaign in config
* Google Maps API key is a config item
