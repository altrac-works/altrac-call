    <h2>Talking points and tips</h2>

    <p><strong>House Bill 23</strong> would expand the current prohibition
    on discussing queer topics in schools so that it would now restrict
    pre-kindergarten all the way through grade 12. It would also ban Pride
    insignias in public schools, and it makes the misgendering of trans kids
    a <em>legal requirement</em> with which school employees must
    comply.</p>

    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>Please call <strong>your state House rep</strong> and tell them
            that you oppose House Bill 23. Call <strong>your state Senator</strong> and tell them that too, if you have time.</li>
        <li>At this stage, and generally when talking to Republican legislators,
            it will be more effective to talk about how the legislature has more
            important priorities, and that the bill is poorly written, has
            unintended consequences, and may drive business away from the state —
            rather than directly talking about the impacts on queer people.
            See the talking points below for some ideas.</li>
        <li>Don’t be discouraged if you reach voicemail — leave a message. Every
            call counts.</li>
        <li>It may be difficult, but be direct and polite. If it helps, you can
            write down what you want to say beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already know what the bill is about and what you want to talk
        about, <a id="reps">skip these tips</a>. Otherwise, <strong>skim
            these bullet points, pick a few that resonate with you, and be prepared
            to expand on them if necessary.</strong></p>

    <ul><li>In Equality Florida v. DeSantis (2022), Florida was forced to gut their "Don't Say Gay" law, which was comparable to this bill. As well, similar bills have already been ruled unconstitutional in other states, including Tennessee and Texas. <strong>Why should Alabama waste its resources and taxpayer dollars just to become the next state where a "Don't Say Gay" law is struck down?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What effect would this bill have on textbooks, materials,
    etc?</strong> Do schools need to throw out textbooks that contain even
    the slightest mention of sexual orientation or gender identity?<br />
    </li>
    <li>The bill is so vague that it prevents discussion about even
    heterosexual relationships – <strong>a female teacher who mentions her
    husband in the classroom would be breaking the law, if this bill were to
    pass</strong>.
    <ul>
    <li>There’s no need to subject our teachers to this kind of excessive
    scrutiny – we should let our teachers spend their time teaching
    instead.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>The bill will harm the state’s health education
    programs.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>The bill’s vague wording disallows discussion of even heterosexual
    relationships, which would be detrimental to sex education.
    <ul>
    <li>Alabama has the fifth highest rate of teen pregnancy in the nation,
    and the sixth highest rate of sexually transmitted diseases.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The bill’s moratorium on discussion of gender would disallow the
    gendering of reproductive health topics like menstruation — teachers
    would have to say “people who menstruate” to avoid mentioning gender
    identity.<br />
    </li>
    <li>We should be acting to educate children on these topics in a
    developmentally appropriate way, rather than banning discussion
    altogether as this bill does.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>This bill takes authority away from teachers to discipline
    students for bullying.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Under this law, teachers cannot discipline students who harass
    others for being gay or trans. This would further contribute to a school
    culture in Alabama where some kids are not welcome based on who they
    are.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>It sets the state up for litigation based on employment
    discrimination.</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>The legal implications of HB244 discourage schools from hiring
    teachers who are gay or trans.<br />
    </li>
    </ul></li>

        <li><strong>This bill holds charter schools that receive public funding
            to a different standard.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Why should charter schools be excluded from this legislation? If
                    this bill is truly a priority, it ought to be a priority across the
                    educational landscape.</li>
